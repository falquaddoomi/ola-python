This is a Python module for Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) python bindings.

OLA is [available here](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/), along with documentation on the
[Python API](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/developer-documentation/python-api/). OLA Python bindings are typically
compiled as part of the larger OLA software install. This is still recommended for most use cases.
